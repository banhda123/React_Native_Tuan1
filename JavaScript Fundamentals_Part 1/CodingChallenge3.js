// There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each 
// other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
// Your tasks:
// 1.  Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
// 2.  Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, 
// and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that 
// as well (draw means they have the same average score)
// 3.  Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a 
// team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a 
// score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum 
// score, as well as multiple else-if blocks �
// 4.  Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when 
// both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 
// points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
// Test data:
// §  Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
// §  Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
// §  Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106

// Test data
const dolphinsScores = [96, 108, 89];
const koalasScores = [88, 91, 110];

  for (let i = 0; i < scores.length; i++) {
    sum += scores[i];

  return sum / scores.length;
};

// Calculate average score for Dolphins and Koalas
const dolphinsAverageScore = calculateAverageScore(dolphinsScores);
const koalasAverageScore = calculateAverageScore(koalasScores);
